        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Jessi. I am 35 years of age and currently residing near Langley, WA on Whidbey Island.
            I graduated from the University of Washington in 2008, and have spent my professional
            career doing GIS and environment - related work in both the public and private sectors, ranging
            from fisheries biology, to urban forestry, to carbon sequestration, to adding map layers to Google Maps 
            (more on these below). I am a musician, having released multiple records both with bands and solo. I am 
            also an avid outdoors person, and do a lot of hiking and scrambling of peaks in the Cascades and 
            Olympics every summer, both on and off trail. This gives me a sense of exploration and adventure!
        </p>
        <h2>Education History</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Capital HS in Olympia, WA in 2004. After that, I attended the University
            of Washington, where I graduated in 2008 with a B.A in Environmental Science. I went back
            to the University of Washington in 2012 for a Certificate in Geographic Information Systems 
            (GIS). More recently, I enrolled in Code Fellows software development bootcamp, and plan to 
            graduate in either June or July of 2021.
        </p>
        <h2>Job Experience</h2>

        <h2>Future Goals</h2>

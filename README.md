This page is about me. We have a bio, work history, education history, and goals. We then have a "Top Ten", and a guessing game that tracks the user's final score:

- There is a game where we assign a random number 0-99 to memory and then the user has 4 chances to guess it.

- We then have a game where we establish a list of favorite colors from a Javascript array, then the user has 6 chances to guess one of them.
